# teamwork-api

## Description

**teamwork-api** is an Emacs library for working with the
[TeamworkPM](http://teamwork.com/) API. 

This library wraps API functionality, but is not meant as a client
(that will probably come in another package)

As always, this is work in process!


## Running Tests

To run unit tests you'll need [Cask](https://github.com/cask/cask) installed.

The following command will run all tests:

```bash
cask exec ert-runner
```
